# React Todo App

This is a simple Todo App built mainly using React State and Hooks. The app allows you to
**add**, **edit** and **delete** Todos.

I decided to keep this app strictly on the front so I could solely focus on React hooks, but no worries! Your new Todos will be saved in Local Storage for the next time you use the app!

## How to use the App

- **Add** => After entering your Todo Item in the input simply press the "**+**" icon or hit enter! Your icon will now be displayed below...

- **Edit** => Not happy with your Todo? No worries, simply hit the edit icon to update your existing Todo.

- **Save your editted text** => After hitting the edit button a new input with your old text will appear. Simply change the text and hit the "Save Button". Your edited text will now be displayed thanks to React Hooks!

- **Cancel the edit** => Change your mind on editting? No problem! Just hit the new cancel button that appears as a "**X**". Your old Todo will remain intact.

- **Delete** => Once your finished with your Todo, simply hit the trash icon and its gone!
